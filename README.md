# Pygame Basic Games

This is the official github of Just Programmer Things.
<br>
The basic code for the following projects have been uploaded(in Pygame):
1. Drawing Pad
2. Pong
3. Squash
4. Tic Tac Toe (2 player)
5. Hangman

<br>

The code is very basic and written from a beginner's perspective. Please feel free to use it and build on top of it. 
For example, can you add the score functionalities to these too?

<br>
P.S. The tutorials for Pygame would be uploaded soon, in video(youtube) and blog(dev.to). So please subscribe. Thank you!

<br>
Make sure that you install Python and Pygame to run these games. For Tic-tac-toe, please install Numpy as well.
